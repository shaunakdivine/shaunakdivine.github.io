# Detecting Fake Reviews Generated by Language Models
### April 23, 2023

This project addresses the growing challenge of fake reviews generated by advanced language models on e-commerce platforms like Amazon. With the increasing sophistication of language models, it has become difficult for users to distinguish between authentic and automated reviews, which can mislead consumers and promote low-quality products.

This project aims to develop an ensemble classifier that combines behavioral and linguistic approaches to predict fake reviews. By analyzing metadata from reviews and identifying patterns in the language used, we created a powerful model capable of detecting fraudulent reviews. Using a dataset that includes both genuine Amazon reviews and text-davinci-0003 generated reviews, we trained multiple models, including Naive Bayes, LSTM, and transformers, to optimize detection accuracy.

The combined approach of leveraging Part-Of-Speech tagging, cosine similarity, and behavioral review data has led to promising results, with our final ensemble model achieving a classification accuracy of **97.98%**. While challenges remain, particularly around the diversity of language model-generated reviews, this work provides a strong foundation for future improvements in detecting fake reviews across e-commerce platforms.
